Farms in the Butambamo area are mostly owned by farmers cooperatives that own the land in the mountains of Nzahaha, a well-known region for fertile sandy loam soil alongside the Rusizi River. During the harvest season in the Butambamo and Nzahaha region, there is heavy rain and a high inclination of soil. The accessibility of the area is very challenging due to the road conditions (mostly muddy). It is for this reason that most of the production at the Butambamo Station is transported by bikes.\"))));\n}","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
